NFT.Storage Integration
NFT.Storage for decentralized data management. Users can input text (prompts) into an interactive box, which are then stored on NFT.Storage. This component not only facilitates the storage of prompt inputs but also showcases their retrieval, presenting them in a convenient sidebar format mimicking OpenAI's interface.

Key Features
OpenAI Prompt Input: A dedicated input box for users to enter prompts intended for OpenAI's services.
Decentralized Data Storage: Utilizes NFT.Storage for storing prompt inputs, ensuring secure, decentralized, and permanent data preservation.
Prompt Retrieval and Display: Automatically retrieves and displays stored prompts in a sidebar format, similar to OpenAI's interface, for easy reference and reuse.
User-Friendly Interface: Offers a straightforward and intuitive UI for seamless interaction with OpenAI and NFT.Storage.


Usage
Storing Prompts in NFT.Storage
Enter the desired prompt in the input box.
Click the 'Submit' button to initiate storing the prompt on NFT.Storage.
View the 'Uploading...' indicator during the storage process.
Retrieving and Displaying Prompts
Post-upload, the component automatically fetches the stored prompts from NFT.Storage, displaying them in a sidebar for easy access and reference.

Error Management
The component logs errors during upload or retrieval processes to the console for troubleshooting and resolution.
Security Considerations
Substitute the placeholder authToken with your NFT.Storage API token.
Ensure secure handling of API tokens in a production environment, potentially using environmental variables or secure storage solutions.

Additional Notes
This component serves as a prototype for integrating OpenAI prompt interactions with decentralized storage solutions provided by NFT.Storage.
For comprehensive information and advanced functionalities, refer to the NFT.Storage and OpenAI documentation.

Worldcoin ID Verification Button
Overview
The WorldcoinButton component integrates the Worldcoin IDKit Widget into a React application, facilitating user verification via Worldcoin's identity service. The component offers a seamless user experience for identity verification, leveraging Worldcoin's secure and privacy-preserving technology.

Features
Worldcoin IDKit Integration: Utilizes the Worldcoin IDKit Widget for identity verification.
Multiple Credential Types: Supports various credential types including Orb and Phone for user verification.

Usage
Integration with Worldcoin IDKit
Replace app_id and action in the IDKitWidget component with your specific credentials obtained from the Worldcoin Developer Portal.
Implement the onSuccess callback to handle the response after successful verification.
The handleVerify function is designed to post the verification response to a specific endpoint for further processing.

User Interaction
Users can initiate the verification process by clicking the "Verify with World ID" button.
Upon successful verification, the configured callbacks handle the response and further actions.

Security and Configuration
Ensure that the Worldcoin app ID and action names are securely managed and correspond to your specific setup in the Developer Portal.
Review and adjust the telemetry settings as per your privacy and data collection policies.
